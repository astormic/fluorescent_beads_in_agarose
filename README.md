How to make a 3D sample of beads for PSF measurements with ~water refractive index (1.33).
- Method adopted from https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/555730v2 (section 3.3):

"We prepared a 1% [w/v] solution of low melting point agarose (A9414, Sigma-Aldrich) in water, heated it up to completely dissolve the agarose, and let it cool down to approx. 40 °C. We then vigorously vortexed the stock solution of TetraSpeck fluorescent beads, and added 2.5 µL to 400 µL of the agarose solution, and vortexed again. We then added a 50 µL drop onto a coverslip. After a few minutes, we mounted the sample in water, and imaged the ~1 mm thick gel that contained immobilized fluorescent beads throughout."

## Materials:
- Red fluorescent beads (~100 nm) extracted from Zebra Mildliner fluorescent markers. [Click here for more details.](https://webdav.tuebingen.mpg.de/LM/FOM2019/FOM2019poster_samplePrep.pdf)
- Low Gelling Temperature Agarose ([Link](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/J66319.14?SID=srch-srp-J66319.14)).
- Glass coverslips #1.5H (170 µm) thickness and ± 5 µm tolerance ([Link](https://histolab.e-line.nu/en1/nya_e-line/Microscope_slides___Coverslips/Coverslips_Standard/Tackglas_Nr_1_24x50_mm_10x100_st_fp_EPREDIA?id=06660)).
- Wet lab equipment (precision scales, hot plate, 20/200/1000uL pipettes and tips, a 5 mL glass container).

## Method:
- Prepare 1-2 slides by taping small coverslips on each side to make a 'bridge' for a large coverslip (so that a ~170um slab of agarose can be deposited in the middle -> **see photos**).
- Turn on the hot plate and set the temperature to 220 °C.
- Put 40 mg of agarose into the glass container, add 1 mL of PBS and swirl around.
- Put the agarose solution on the hot plate until just boiling.
- Allow the agarose to cool until still noticeably warm to touch (i.e. above body temperature) and then pipette 400uL into 1.5mL tube. This starts the clock since the agarose will now cool quickly and solidify -> **so be ready!**
- **Immediately** add 4uL of beads to the agarose (consider 6uL for higher density).
- **Quickly** pipette 50uL of agarose/bead solution into the middle of the pre-prepared slides.
- **Now** squash the agarose/bead droplet with the bridging coverslip and tape down.
- The beads should be good for ~24hours (note that as they dry out the concentration of beads and agarose goes up...).
- 1-4% agarose should have a refractive index in the range 1.335-1.339 (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-64103-3, figure 3a).

Note: it should be possible to increase the refractive index by using sucrose-water, glucose-water or glycerol-water solutions.
